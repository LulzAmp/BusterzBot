# BusterzBot

BusterzBot is a Simple IRC Bot with DoS functions, written in PHP. I based this bot on [a wikihow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Develop-an-IRC-Bot).
BusterzBot also comes with an API for the '*API DoS*' function, this API only works if it's hosted on a UNIX-Based system.


#### Commands (more soon)
* **@moo**, funny command made by the author of the above-mentioned wikihow article.
* **@bbhelp**, prints a help menu with all commands.
* **@dos**, sends a DoS Attack using PHP functions (udp,tcp,http,https).
* **@apidos**, sends a DoS attack using the api.

#### How to run
1. Install PHP.
2. Linux: `php path/to/bot.php`
   Windows: `C:\php\php.exe path/to/bot.php`
3. That's it, easy, right?
